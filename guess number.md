If the player is less than 10, he will not play. If he is 10 or greater than 10, he will play.
There is a group of numbers. The player guesses from 1 to 30.
You ask the player if his number is here or not. If the number is here, you write down the first number in the row of the group of numbers. If the number is not there, you do not add it up. You keep asking him until you get the number that the player guessed.
